## Online Ping-Pong Game: Detailed Specification Document

### 1. Introduction

This document provides a detailed technical specification for the Online Ping-Pong Game, built upon the outlined Product Requirements Document (PRD). It expands on key features, defines technical requirements, and specifies external system integrations necessary for a robust, engaging, and scalable online multiplayer experience.

### 2. Key Features - Detailed Specification

#### 2.1. Real-time Multiplayer

*   **Requirement:** Enable 1v1 live matches between players.
*   **Technical Specification:**
    *   Utilize WebSockets for low-latency, full-duplex communication between client and server.
    *   Server-authoritative game state to prevent cheating and ensure consistency.
    *   Client-side prediction and server reconciliation for smooth gameplay experience, even with minor network latency.
    *   Dedicated game servers (or serverless functions for match hosting) to manage game sessions.
    *   Match start: Players are assigned to a unique game room ID.
    *   Match end: Server registers winner/loser, updates player stats.

#### 2.2. Intuitive Controls

*   **Requirement:** Simple and responsive control scheme optimized for web/mobile devices.
*   **Technical Specification:**
    *   **Web (Desktop):** Mouse-based control for paddle movement (X and Y axis). Left-click for paddle hit, duration/speed of click for power. Keyboard alternatives (WASD/Arrow keys) for paddle movement, spacebar for hit.
    *   **Mobile (Touch):** Touch-and-drag for paddle movement. Tap for paddle hit, duration/speed of tap for power.
    *   **Input Latency:** Target maximum input-to-render latency of 50ms.
    *   **Control Customization:** Future consideration for sensitivity settings.

#### 2.3. Physics-Based Gameplay

*   **Requirement:** Realistic ball physics (spin, speed, bounce) for an authentic feel.
*   **Technical Specification:**
    *   **Physics Engine:** Integrate a lightweight 2D physics engine (e.g., Matter.js or custom implementation) on the server.
    *   **Ball Properties:** Mass, drag, restitution (bounciness).
    *   **Paddle-Ball Interaction:**
        *   Angle of incidence determines reflection angle.
        *   Paddle speed and direction impart spin and velocity to the ball.
        *   Topspin/backspin mechanics: Impact ball trajectory and bounce.
        *   Slice mechanics: Lateral spin for curved shots.
    *   **Collision Detection:** Precise collision detection between ball, paddles, net, and table boundaries.
    *   **Server-Side Simulation:** All physics calculations performed server-side for authoritative game state.

#### 2.4. Matchmaking System

*   **Requirement:** Skill-based matchmaking to ensure balanced and competitive games.
*   **Technical Specification:**
    *   **Elo Rating System:** Implement a custom or standard Elo rating system to track player skill.
    *   **Matchmaking Queue:** Players are placed into a queue when searching for a match.
    *   **Algorithm:** Match players with similar Elo ratings (e.g., within X points).
    *   **Queue Prioritization:** Prioritize players based on queue time to avoid long waits.
    *   **Region-Based Matching:** Optionally match players within geographical regions to minimize latency.
    *   **Game Server Allocation:** Once a match is found, assign players to an available game server instance.

#### 2.5. Player Profiles & Stats

*   **Requirement:** Track wins, losses, rankings, and other relevant player statistics.
*   **Technical Specification:**
    *   **User ID:** Unique identifier for each player.
    *   **Database Schema:** Store `userID`, `username`, `eloRating`, `wins`, `losses`, `draws`, `matchesPlayed`, `winRate`, `highestElo`, `longestWinStreak`, `totalPlayTime`.
    *   **Leaderboards:** Implement global and potentially regional leaderboards based on Elo rating and other statistics.
    *   **API Endpoints:** Secure API endpoints for retrieving and updating player profiles and statistics.
    *   **Data Consistency:** Ensure atomic updates for match outcomes to prevent data corruption.

#### 2.6. Customizable Avatars/Paddles

*   **Requirement:** Personalize in-game appearance with unlockable cosmetic items.
*   **Technical Specification:**
    *   **Asset Management:** Store cosmetic item metadata (ID, name, type, unlock condition) and associated graphic assets (e.g., PNG for paddle skins, avatar icons).
    *   **Inventory System:** Each player profile includes an array or list of owned cosmetic items.
    *   **Unlock Mechanics:** Items can be unlocked via:
        *   In-game currency (earned by playing matches).
        *   Level progression.
        *   Achievements.
        *   Real-money purchases (if monetization is enabled).
    *   **Selection Mechanism:** UI allows players to select their active avatar and paddle skin.
    *   **Server-Side Validation:** Ensure players own selected items before applying them in-game.

#### 2.7. Spectator Mode

*   **Requirement:** Optionally watch ongoing matches between other players.
*   **Technical Specification:**
    *   **Match Listing:** Provide a list of active public matches.
    *   **Spectator Stream:**
        *   Server sends real-time game state updates to spectators (player positions, ball position, score).
        *   Updates are "read-only" and a subset of the data sent to active players to optimize bandwidth.
        *   Latency for spectators can be slightly higher than for players.
    *   **Player Anonymity (Optionally):** Spectators may see player IDs or anonymized names.
    *   **Join/Leave:** Spectators can join and leave ongoing matches without affecting gameplay.
    *   **Capacity:** Limit the number of spectators per match to prevent server overload.

### 3. Target Users & User Stories (Example)

*   **Casual Gamer:** "As a casual gamer, I want to quickly find a match and play a few rounds without complex setups, so I can have fun during my breaks."
*   **Ping-Pong Enthusiast:** "As a ping-pong enthusiast, I want realistic ball physics, so I can practice different shots and strategies online."
